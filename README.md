# Programming Fundamentals Coursework 🎓

This repository is a collection of assignments, laboratory works, and projects completed during the **"Fundamentals of Programming"** course at Tallinn Industrial Education Center.

It documents my journey from learning basic Python syntax to building desktop applications with graphical user interfaces (GUI) and database integration.

### 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by topics and complexity:

* **📂 FinalWork** – The capstone project of the course. A complete application featuring:
    * **GUI:** Built with `tkinter` library.
    * **Database:** Integration with SQLite (`dbquery.py`, `data.db`).
    * **Logic:** Modular Python scripts.

* **📂 Programmeerimise alused** (Course Modules):
    * `Grafika/` – Experiments with **Tkinter** (Windows, Buttons, Canvas).
    * `list/` & `dict/` – Data structures practice (Arrays, Dictionaries, HashMaps).
    * `def/` – Functional programming concepts (Functions, Parameters, Return values).
    * `AllBeforeList/` – Basic algorithms (Loops `for/while`, conditionals `if/else`, flowcharts).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** `tkinter` (GUI), `sqlite3` (Database), `random`, `math`.
* **Tools:** Visual Studio, PyCharm.
